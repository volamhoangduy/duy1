Ho Chi Minh City authorities on Monday ordered schools to close down from Tuesday to prevent COVID-19 transmission when Vietnam is battling a new wave of local infections.

Students from kindergarten to high school levels, including those enrolled at vocational and continuing education facilities, in the city will stay home and switch to virtual learning until the end of Friday, the municipal Peopleâ€™s Committee said in an urgent dispatch on Monday afternoon.

They will start the Lunar New Year holiday on Saturday and return to school on February 17, according to a previously announced schedule.
